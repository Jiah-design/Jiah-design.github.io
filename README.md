## Projects and Labs

### [Project 1](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p1/)

Using the command line interface (CLI) to create a number of folders and displaying the folders in a tree-like structure
Use the ping command, and practice using the break keyboard sequence to become more familiar with CLI
Create and execute a JavaScript files using Node.js and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) terminal and Run and Debug

### [Project 2](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p2/)

Using the command line interface (CLI) and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to create and work with a git repository (repo)
Refactor the JavaScript program from project 1 to practice using git and practice refactoring
- Create and use a .gitignore file
- Diff split screen

### [Project 3](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p3/)

Creating a "coinage" code module that is capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. Update "server" code file as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will display an initial web page with web links to to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.

### [Project 4](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p4/)

Creating a REST API that works with a "data" source of questions and answers. All codes used to work with the data source are created in a code module, and tested in the code module code using provided testing codes. Node.js REST API is created to handle the GET verb. 

### [Project 5](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p5/)

Creating a Monster Game program using classes. The game will create monsters with initial life values, and minimum life values for the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. The game will include a delay before each life drain.

### [Project 6](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p6/)

Using classes to develop a program that will return the perimeter and area of a Shape (triangle, rectangle, square). Creating a Shape class that will serve as a base class for two other classes, a Rectangle class that will inherit from Shape class, and a Triangle class that also will inherit from the Shape class.

The base Shape class will provide the common functionality of a method that returns the perimeter value. Each of the other two classes will provide their own versions of a method that returns the area value. 

### [Project 7](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-p7/)

Creating either an organization-level or user-level GitHub Page, and adding content to this Page.
Page will include repos for each of the labs and projects completed in the CIT 281 course 
Each GitHub Page of the labs and projects provides a brief description of the lab or project, and a screen capture
Adding links to the organization or user Page to each of the labs and projects

### [Lab 1](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-lab1/)

Practice using software tools such as terminal or shell commands and keyboard shortcuts to execute and produce Node.js server-side JavaScript files

### [Lab 2](https://jiah-design.github.io/cit281-lab2/)

Using CLI commands for directory, file manipulation, and git commands (establishing new git repository, initializing JavaScript files, and tracking files).

### [Lab 3]

Practice refactoring JavaScript code to use more modern syntaxs such as destructuring objects, converting normal functions into arrow function expressions and using for..in and for..of syntax with objects and arrays.

### [Lab 4]

Practice using Fastify to create web servers in VSCode.

### [Lab 5]

Using Postman to test fastify server application with GET and POST and respond with JSON

### [Lab 6]

Creating a digital book library using JavaScript classes and test the Library class by creating a Library instance, adding the Book object and use all of the Library methods to output the count of books in the library, and the books in the library.

### [Lab 7]

Create GitHub organization for the CIT Minor and using clone to manage respostory in local system then pushing changes back into GitHub

### [Lab 8]

Using fastify and node-fetch package to fetch JSONPlaceholder data

### [Lab 9]

Working through GitHub Learning Lab "Create a released based workflow" course.
